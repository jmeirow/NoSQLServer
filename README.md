NoSQLServer is a .NET library for building great .NET applications using a class-centric approach to modeling and implementing your domain. NoSQLServer gives you the ease of NoSQL-style programming while recognizing that bringing a new technology platform into your shop is not always a viable option. NoSQLServer will run (with slight modifications) on virtually any RDBMS. 

##Getting Started

NoSQLServer gives you a powerful, object-based way to build dynamic applicaitons that enables a clean separation of concerns and gives you full control object composition without the need for tables and stored procedures for enjoyable, agile development and easy change-mangement/deployment.

##Easier Development

Entity Framework? Forget about it! Your business logic or controllers can directly read/write view models providing increased performance with decreased code! Get rid of those mappings and the havoc wreaked upon your builds when a table changes. Best of all, the ASP.NET MVC view wizards work with NoSQLServer objects out of the box.


##Easier Change Management

No "CREATE/ALTER TABLE" scripts and no stored procedures mean simplified change management because there are far fewer code objects to develop, maintain and deploy.
